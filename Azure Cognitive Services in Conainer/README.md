# Azure Cognitive Service Containers 

Container support in Azure Cognitive Services allows developers to use the same rich APIs that are available in Azure, 
and enables flexibility in where to deploy and host the services that come with Docker containers. 

Container support is currently available in preview for a subset of Azure Cognitive Services, including parts of:

* [Anomaly Detector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/overview)
* [Computer Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/home)
* [Face](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/overview)
* [Form Recognizer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083826&clcid=0x409)
* [Language Understanding (LUIS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-container-howto)
* [Personalizer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083923&clcid=0x409)
* [Speech Service API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083926&clcid=0x409)
* [Text Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview)

Containerization is an approach to software distribution in which an application or service, 
including its dependencies & configuration, is packaged together as a container image. With little or no modification, 
a container image can be deployed on a container host. Containers are isolated from each other and the underlying operating system,
with a smaller footprint than a virtual machine. Containers can be instantiated from container images for short-term tasks,
and removed when no longer needed.
